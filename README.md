Core Conversion Process
1. Pattern Recognition & Replacement
The converter uses regular expressions to identify Python syntax patterns and replace them with Java equivalents. For example:

print(...) becomes System.out.println(...)
def function_name(): becomes public static returnType function_name()
if condition: becomes if (condition) {

2. Type Inference
Since Python is dynamically typed and Java is statically typed, the converter analyzes variable assignments to infer types:

name = "Hello" becomes String name = "Hello"
count = 42 becomes int count = 42
price = 19.99 becomes double price = 19.99

3. Structure Analysis
The converter examines the code structure to determine what Java components are needed:

Detects if imports are required (Scanner for input, ArrayList for lists)
Identifies if code should be wrapped in a main method
Recognizes class definitions and converts constructors

4. Indentation & Brace Management
Python uses indentation for code blocks, while Java uses braces. The converter:

Tracks indentation levels in the Python code
Converts each indented block to proper { } braced blocks in Java
Ensures proper closing braces are added

5. Context-Aware Conversion
The converter maintains context about what it's processing:

Function return types are inferred by scanning for return statements
Class methods are handled differently than standalone functions
self references are converted to this in Java classes

Limitations

Handles common Python constructs but not advanced features like decorators, generators, or complex data structures
Type inference is basic - complex types may need manual adjustment
Some Python idioms don't have direct Java equivalents and may need restructuring

The converter is designed for educational purposes and basic code translation, making it easier to understand how Python concepts map to Java syntax.
